[3/07/2025 4:10 PM] Abhinav AI MACE: Please find the programs to be completed tomorrow. Each student is required to bring a rough record with the algorithm written in it.
[3/07/2025 4:10 PM] Abhinav AI MACE: 1.Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm.
Use play tennis data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to
classify a new sample.
[3/07/2025 4:10 PM] Abhinav AI MACE: 2. To implement and evaluate a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for the Iris dataset.
[3/07/2025 4:10 PM] Abhinav AI MACE: 3. To implement and visualize the Gradient Descent algorithm to find the optimal parameters (slope and intercept) for a simple linear regression model using an apporpriate data set.
[3/07/2025 4:10 PM] Abhinav AI MACE: Kindly convey this message to the entire class and ensure students follow the instructions according to their respective lab slots.
