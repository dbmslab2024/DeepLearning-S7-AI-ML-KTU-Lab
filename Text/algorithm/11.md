# Neural Machine Translation using Autoencoder-Decoder Architecture

I'll help you implement a shallow autoencoder-decoder network for English to Hindi machine translation using PyTorch, and provide the algorithm and theory you requested for your lab manual.

## Theory: Neural Machine Translation using Autoencoders

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a deep learning approach to translating text from one language to another. The autoencoder-decoder architecture is a powerful paradigm for this task:

**Autoencoders** are neural networks trained to copy their input to their output, typically through a bottleneck representation (encoding) that captures essential features of the input. 

In machine translation, we use an **encoder-decoder** framework where:
- The **encoder** processes the source language sentence and compresses it into a fixed-length context vector
- The **decoder** takes this context vector and generates the target language translation
- This architecture allows the model to learn the mapping between languages through end-to-end training

The sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model is particularly effective because it can handle variable-length input and output sequences, making it ideal for translation tasks.

## Implementation

Let's implement a shallow autoencoder-decoder for English to Hindi translation:

```python name=nmt_autoencoder.py

```

## Algorithm for Neural Machine Translation using Autoencoders (10 steps)

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load English-Hindi parallel corpus and normalize text by removing special characters and converting to lowercase.

2. **Tokenization**: Create vocabulary dictionaries for both languages, mapping words to unique indices and adding special tokens like `<SOS>`, `<EOS>`, `<UNK>`, and `<PAD>`.

3. **Dataset Preparation**: Convert sentences to sequences of indices, add start/end tokens, and create data loaders with padding for batched processing.

4. **Encoder Design**: Implement an encoder using embedding layer followed by GRU to convert source sentences into context vectors.

5. **Decoder Design**: Create a decoder with embedding layer, GRU, and output layer to generate target language from context vector.

6. **Loss Function**: Define cross-entropy loss function that ignores padding tokens to evaluate translation quality.

7. **Training Loop**: Implement teacher forcing technique, where the model alternates between using ground truth and its own predictions during training.

8. **Gradient Management**: Apply gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients common in sequence models.

9. **Inference Process**: Implement greedy decoding for translating new sentences by taking the highest probability output at each step.

10. **Evaluation**: Test the model with various English sentences and evaluate the quality of Hindi translations produced.

This shallow autoencoder-decoder model demonstrates the fundamental concepts of neural machine translation while being computationally efficient enough for a lab setting.
