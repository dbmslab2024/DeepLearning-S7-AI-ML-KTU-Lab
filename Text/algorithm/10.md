# Time Series Forecasting for NIFTY-50 using PyTorch


Exp 10 Implement time series forecasting for the NIFTY-50 dataset. Design and train a model to predict future values of the NIFTY-50 stock market index based on historical data

## Brief Theory

Time series forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on previously observed values. For stock market indices like NIFTY-50, these predictions are based on historical price patterns. PyTorch provides powerful deep learning tools for time series forecasting, particularly through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) which are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. These models can learn complex patterns in stock market movements by processing sequences of historical data points, making them valuable for financial forecasting tasks.

## Algorithm (10-step)

1. Import necessary libraries and load the NIFTY-50 historical dataset
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize data, and convert to appropriate format)
3. Split the data into training and testing sets using a chronological split
4. Create windowed sequences from the time series data for supervised learning
5. Define a recurrent neural network model (LSTM/GRU) in PyTorch with appropriate layers
6. Initialize optimizer and loss function (typically MSE for regression tasks)
7. Train the model on the training dataset for a set number of epochs
8. Evaluate the model performance on the test set using metrics like RMSE and MAE
9. Visualize the actual vs. predicted values to assess model accuracy
10. Use the trained model to forecast future NIFTY-50 values beyond the dataset

## Implementation

Here's a PyTorch implementation for time series forecasting on the NIFTY-50 dataset:

```python

```

This implementation:

1. Loads and preprocesses the NIFTY-50 dataset
2. Creates time series sequences for supervised learning
3. Builds an LSTM model for time series prediction
4. Trains the model on historical data
5. Evaluates the model's performance
6. Visualizes the predictions against actual values
7. Forecasts future NIFTY-50 index values

You'll need to acquire the NIFTY-50 historical data from a reliable source like Yahoo Finance or the National Stock Exchange (NSE) website and save it as a CSV file before running this code.
