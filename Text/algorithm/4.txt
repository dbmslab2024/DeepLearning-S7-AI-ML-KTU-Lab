**Algorithm: Feedforward Neural Network for CIFAR-10 Image Classification**

1. Import the necessary libraries for deep learning (PyTorch), data handling, and image processing.
2. Download and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset, normalizing the images and creating training and test data loaders.
3. Define a feedforward neural network model class with three hidden layers, customizable hidden units, and activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, or Sigmoid).
4. Initialize the neural network model with specified hidden units and activation function.
5. Specify the loss function as CrossEntropyLoss and select the Adam optimizer for training.
6. For each epoch, set the model to training mode and iterate over all training batches.
7. In each batch, flatten input images, pass them through the neural network, compute the loss, and update the model weights using backpropagation.
8. After training, set the model to evaluation mode and test its performance on the test dataset.
9. Calculate the total number of correctly classified test images and compute the overall test accuracy.
10. Repeat the above steps for different combinations of hidden units and activation functions, and compare the resulting test accuracies.
