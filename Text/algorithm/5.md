**Step-by-Step Algorithm**

1. **Import Required Libraries:** Import PyTorch, torchvision, and other necessary libraries for neural network construction and data handling.
2. **Set Hyperparameters:** Define batch size, number of epochs, learning rate, network architecture, and device configuration.
3. **Prepare CIFAR-10 Dataset:** Download and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset using normalization and create DataLoader objects for training and testing sets.
4. **Define Neural Network Architecture:** Construct a feedforward neural network with three hidden layers, using ReLU activation in each hidden layer.
5. **Implement Initialization Techniques:** Write functions for Xavier and Kaiming initialization; set up the model to accept different weight initialization strategies.
6. **Configure Regularization Options:** Add options for dropout in hidden layers and L2 regularization (weight decay) in the optimizer.
7. **Train Baseline Model:** Train the network using default initialization and no regularization, recording training and testing accuracy and loss per epoch.
8. **Repeat Training with Xavier and Kaiming Initialization:** Train the network separately with Xavier and then Kaiming initialization, recording results for each.
9. **Apply Dropout and L2 Regularization:** Train additional models with dropout and L2 regularization, respectively, and record their performance metrics.
10. **Analyze and Compare Results:** Plot and compare the loss and accuracy curves for all experiments, and analyze the impact of each technique on convergence speed, accuracy, and overfitting.
