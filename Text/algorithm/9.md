# RNN, LSTM, and GRU for Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Dataset

## Theoretical Background

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are a class of neural networks designed for processing sequential data. Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have feedback connections that allow them to maintain a "memory" of previous inputs. This makes them suitable for tasks involving sequences like text.

However, standard RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, making them ineffective for capturing long-term dependencies in sequences. This limitation led to the development of:

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, which use a gating mechanism to control information flow. LSTMs have three gates: input, forget, and output gates that regulate what information to add, remove, or output from the cell state, enabling them to capture long-range dependencies.

**Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)** are a simplified variant of LSTMs with fewer parameters. They combine the forget and input gates into a single "update gate" and merge the cell state and hidden state, offering comparable performance to LSTMs with greater computational efficiency.

For sentiment analysis tasks like IMDB review classification, these architectures process text sequences word by word, capturing contextual information to determine sentiment polarity (positive or negative).

## 10-Step Algorithm for RNN-based Sentiment Analysis

1. **Data Preparation**: Load the IMDB dataset and preprocess by tokenizing text, building vocabulary, and converting to numerical sequences.
2. **Text Representation**: Convert text to fixed-length sequences with padding and create efficient DataLoaders.
3. **Model Architecture**: Design three models - vanilla RNN, LSTM, and GRU with embedding layer, recurrent layer, and output layer.
4. **Hyperparameter Selection**: Set embedding dimensions, hidden dimensions, batch size, and learning rate.
5. **Model Training**: Train each model using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer for a fixed number of epochs.
6. **Validation**: Evaluate models on validation set after each epoch and save best-performing models.
7. **Performance Comparison**: Compare accuracy, loss curves, and training time across the three architectures.
8. **Model Testing**: Evaluate final models on test set to measure generalization performance.
9. **Prediction Analysis**: Generate predictions on sample reviews to visualize model behavior and effectiveness.
10. **Visualization**: Create plots showing performance metrics and comparison between different RNN architectures.

This implementation will demonstrate how LSTM and GRU architectures generally outperform standard RNNs for sentiment analysis, with LSTMs typically achieving higher accuracy but GRUs being more computationally efficient. The visualizations will clearly show these trade-offs and help understand which architecture is most suitable for the sentiment analysis task.
