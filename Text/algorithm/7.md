1. **Import Libraries:** Import PyTorch, torchvision, and related modules for neural networks and data loading.
2. **Set Hyperparameters:** Define batch size, epochs, learning rate, and device (CPU/GPU).
3. **Prepare Data:** Download and normalize the MNIST dataset, and create DataLoaders for training and testing.
4. **Define CNN Model:** Build a CNN class with two convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and two fully connected layers.
5. **Initialize Model:** Instantiate the CNN model and move it to the selected device.
6. **Set Loss and Optimizer:** Use cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer for training.
7. **Train Model:** For each epoch, iterate over training data, perform forward pass, compute loss, backpropagate, and update weights.
8. **Evaluate Model:** After each epoch, test the model on the test dataset and calculate accuracy and average loss.
9. **Save Best Model:** Save the model parameters if the current test accuracy is the best so far.
10. **Report Results:** Print the best test accuracy achieved after all epochs.
